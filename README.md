Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

My client for this project was Artemis Financial in the fictional financial services sector. Artemis Financial required software solutions that provided strong security mechanisms to protect both customer information and financial transactions. Artemis Financial required me to examine their Java Spring Boot application for possible security weaknesses related to SSL certificate processing and dependency control while following software security best practices.

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I demonstrated effective vulnerability management by updating dependencies and correctly setting up SSL certificates for secure communication. I used Maven Dependency-Check as one of my primary tools to detect security vulnerabilities. Secure coding practices protect sensitive data while maintaining customer confidence. The implementation of strong software security measures defends against data breaches and legal issues while stopping financial losses to boost company reputation and stability.

Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

Users found the configuration and execution of the Maven Dependency-Check tool together with result analysis to be the most challenging aspect. The tool provided assistance by automating outdated or vulnerable dependency identification which simplified application security maintenance.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I strengthened my security approach by enabling SSL for encrypted communications and kept existing dependencies while implementing secure coding practices. My strategy includes continuous use of Dependency-Check along with static code analysis tools and penetration testing to assess vulnerabilities and choose proper mitigation approaches.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I had to run application tests for every major update to verify its proper functioning. I performed security checks using Maven Dependency-Check to detect new vulnerabilities after completing the code refactoring.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used Java, Maven, Spring Boot, and the OWASP Dependency-Check tool. I also followed secure coding practices, such as input validation and regular code reviews. These tools and habits will help me write more secure and reliable code in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would demonstrate to potential employers my secure Java Spring Boot application as well as my documentation and reports on Maven build configuration and dependency checks. My work exemplifies my skills in identifying and fixing security problems while using professional tools to ensure software functionality.
